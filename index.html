	<h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>	
	<h4>Green marketing describes a company's efforts to advertise the environmental sustainability of its business practices.<br>
     The emergence of a consumer population that is becoming increasingly concerned with environmental and social factors has led to green marketing becoming an important component of corporate public relations.<br>
     One criticism of green marketing practices is that they tend to favor large corporations that can absorb the additional costs entailed by these programs.</h4>
